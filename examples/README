# Examples for the spath3 library

Most of the examples contain a couple of lines at the start to regenerate the package files from the `spath3_code.dtx` file so that I don't have to keep remembering to regenerate them when testing a feature using an example file.
If the example starts with something like:

```
\RequirePackage{shellesc}
\immediate\write18{cd ..; tex spath3_code.dtx}
```

then remove or comment out these lines.

## Current examples

These are examples that ought to work with the current version of the library.

* calligraphy_closed.tex

  Testing how the calligraphy package works with closed paths.

* calligraphy_decorations.tex

  Tests the decorations part of the calligraphy library.

* calligraphy_test.tex

  This is the main test suite for the calligraphy library.

* knightstour.tex

  Primarily an example of SVG export, but also demonstrates how to use paths piecemeal when working with the full path causes TeX to complain.

* knot-examples.tex

  Some examples of knot and link diagrams that show some of the features of the knot library.

* knots_test.tex

  Key test file for knots with lots of examples.

* localglobal.tex

  Basic knot to test if I'm doing the local/global assignments correctly.

* new_prime_knots.tex

  Prime knots up to 7-7 using the `spath3` TikZ library.

* prime_knots.tex

  Prime knots up to 7-7 using the `knots` TikZ library.

* spath3_test.tex

  Main test file for the `spath3` library.

* spath_interface.tex

  Testing welding soft paths together.

* testpaths.tex

  Defines the paths used in the test suite in the main directory.

* trefoil_moves_new.tex

  Showing how to deform one view of a trefoil into another, using the `spath3` library. 

* trefoil_moves.tex

  Showing how to deform one view of a trefoil into another, using the `knots` library. 


## Examples from TeX-SX

Quite a few of the examples come from questions on TeX-SX.

* knot_pins.tex

  Testing label styles for knots.

* knotsarrows.tex

  Various ways of decorating a strand within a knot environment.

* knots_celtic.tex

  Demonstrating how to get rid of the artefacts formed by using the double style to render celtic knots.

* knot_shading.tex

  Filling the middle of a knot.

* knots_more_celtic.tex

  A more complicated celtic knot (this was en route to the [`celtic`](https://github.com/loopspace/celtic) package).  

* knots_small.tex

  Everyone on TeX-SX likes drawing knots small, it seems.

* knots_triple.tex

  Testing triple intersections.

* nfoil.tex

  Code for an n-foil knot.

* olympic.tex

  Linked olympic rings.

* smallcrossings.tex

  Crossings close together strike again.

* twistedpair_celtic.tex

  Another example from TeX-SX

* twistedpair.tex

  Different version of the above


## Old Examples

These are examples that I haven't kept up to date with the latest version of the code.
Generally, they are ones that I've used to test out some feature or figure out some bug and which once that's tested or figured out then I've not updated them since.
I find them useful to look back on for ideas so I keep them.

* calligraphy_error.tex

  The file name suggests this was to test an error.  I don't recall what that was.

* findintersection.tex

  Testing some early ideas on splitting paths at intersection points.  The ideas persisted, but the syntax didn't.

* pentagram.tex

  Yet another knot diagram, showing artefacts from the double effect.

* renderpath.tex

  Testing saving and restoring a soft path with old syntax.

* welding.tex

  Welding two paths together
